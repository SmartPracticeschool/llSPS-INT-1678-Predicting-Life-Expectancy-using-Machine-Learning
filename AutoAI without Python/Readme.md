Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

# DataSet
The dataset used for predicting the life expectancy using machine learning has been developed by the WHO and the file that contains the dataset is of the name life.csv

# ML Model
The Ml Model has been developed using the Watson Studio and by using the various regression techniques. The notebook scoringEndpoint.ipynb contains the ML Model for predicting the Life Expectancy.

# UI using Node Red
The UI has been developed using Node Red and linked with the ML Model using the endpoint url. It is stored in the NodeRedFlow.json

# Project Report
A project report is available.

# Video Demonstration
The demonstration of working of model and its setup is shown with the help of a video.
